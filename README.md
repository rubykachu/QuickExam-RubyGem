# QuickExam

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/quick_exam.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/quick_exam)

You can shuffle or randomize quiz questions and answers. Shuffling is also an effective way of preventing cheating because no two learners get questions in the same order while taking the same quiz.

The gem `quick_exam` **only supports txt, docx and Webpage html from Word** format. You can completely change the format of the questions and answers.


| Description | Example |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Format for a Question: Not case sensitive. The starting must be letters | `Q`, `Question` or `CÃ¢u` etc... |
| Format for an Answer: Not case sensitive. Starting with a letter or a number | `A`, `a` or `1`, `2` etc... |
| Format for an Correct answer: Not case sensitive | `!!!T` |

**Sample data**
```
Q1. Who are all ________ people?
A. this
B. those !!!T
C. them
D. that

Q2. Claude is ________.
A. Frenchman
B. a French !!!T
C. a Frenchman
D. French man

Q3. I ____ a car next year.
